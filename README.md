# BitNom
## What does it do!?

BitNom allows you to take a hex dump of network traffic and show how it's formatted in an easy, human readable way. This will allow you to 
view header schemas, data schemas, etc. without having to read though hundreds of pages of technical data ( becuase I did it for you ;) )

## WIP

This project is currently a WIP, and I am currently working on laying out the DNS protocol. After that will be TCP/UDP, then IP. After IP I will consider
looking into other protocols to "decode".
